        <h1 class="portHeader">Speech-to-Braille</h1>

        <p>
            Speech-to-braille was my senior capstone project and dives into:
            <br><strong>AI, Embedded Systems & Hardware Integration, Multithreading & Concurrency, Networking, and Natural Language Processing</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a hardware-software system that converts spoken audio into braille output. A user speaks into the system, and the audio is transcribed using a speech recognition API (AssemblyAI). The transcribed text is then converted into braille representations and physically output from a RassberyPI. The Pi sends the signals to GPIO pins that each control an elctromagnetic Solonoid that will extend and represent a braille dot.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I even presented the project at the University of North Florida's technology symposia. Audience members were able to speek into the microphone and watch as their voice turned into braille.
            
            <br>we were voted by audience as one of the top projects.
