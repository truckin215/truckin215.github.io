        <h1>Speech-to-Braille</h1>
        <p>
            Speech-to-braille was my senior cap stone project and dives into:
            <br><strong>AI, Embeddded Systems & Hardware Integration, Multithreading & Concurrency, Networking, and Natural Language Processing</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a hardware-software system that converts spoken audio into braille output. A user speaks into the system, and the audio is transcribed using a speech recognition API (AssemblyAI). The transcribed text is then converted into braille representations and physically output from a RassberyPI. The Pi sends the signals to GPIO pins that each control an elctro-Magnet Solonoid that will extend and represent a braille dot.
